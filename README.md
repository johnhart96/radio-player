# Radio Player
This was a very simple quick app that I wrote to embed two of the most popular radio playing websites in the UK, into a desktop app for the main 3 platforms.
I totally get that this app offers no more fexability than browsing to them in your web browser. But it just provides a simple app to get to them quickly.
When I am working. I have this in my dock (macOS) and just click it to get music going quickly, it also means that I don't have the radio playing in my browser.
